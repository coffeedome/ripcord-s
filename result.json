This release fixes the bug and makes sure that keys are deduplicated correctly.\r\n\r\nAdditionally we have also improved our Gitpod configuration which should make it easier for contributors to get up and running.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n## üìú Documentation updates\r\n\r\n* docs(maintenance): add clarification about async decorators (#1778) by @dreamorosi\r\n\r\n## üêõ Bug and hot fixes\r\n\r\n* fix(metrics): deduplicate dimensions when serialising (#1780) by @am29d\r\n\r\n## üîß Maintenance\r\n\r\n* chore(maintenance): improve Gitpod config (#1782) by @dreamorosi\r\n\r\n## This release was made possible by the following contributors:\r\n\r\n@am29d, @dreamorosi\r\n",
